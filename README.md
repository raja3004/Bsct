I have developed a website to book seat in cinema theatre.  This has 5 major modules and they are Movie selection, Login/Signup, Seats and Food booking, Payment gateway and Cancellation. Here the movie is selected on different parameters.I have used Bootstrap for the UI.
Project flow:
1. User will select the City name where the prominent city names gets displayed.
2. After selecting the user will be directed to the page where movie screening at that city is displayed. The description and duration is also mentioned.
3. After selecting the movie user will be directed to that movie page where the Trailer, Cast details and rating gets displayed. Along with it the list of theatre screening that particular movie is also displayed with time slots and date.
4. User will be selecting the desired time slot and procedd to book the seat.
5. System will allow only the registered seats to proceed so if the user is new user then he/she must register or else login is sufficient.
6. Now the user will be directed to select the seat and UI designed for it will allow user to select seats baseed on its availability.
7. System will ask user to order food if user wishes then the food ordering page gets displayed where the menu and bill summary gets displayed.
8. Atlast the user will be directed to the payment page where wide option of payment modes are provided.
9. In addition the cancellation and admin pages need to be done and it is under development.
